# Creating with API requests

This section uses a Docker container to run a local instance of [requestbin](https://github.com/Runscope/requestbin#deploy-your-own-instance-using-docker).

The local server instance is managed via a git submodule. To install and run the server:

```bash
# update the submodule
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# run the docker container and server
$ npm run server
```

To create a URL to make requests against, go to the URL the app is served at
(likely [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)), and click 'Create a RequestBin'.

Refreshing the page where the URL is generated after requests have been made
will list those requests.

## Creating requests

HTTP requests are comprised of 4 parts:

- method
- url
- headers
- body

Firstly, generate a URL using RequestBin.

### `GET` with query params

- Method: `GET`
- Address: `[requestbin-url]?foo=bar`

On the RequestBin page for that URL you'll see a **QueryString** heading with
the query params used in the request.

**NOTE:** Postman does not URL encode query paramaters by default. e.g. in

- Method: `GET`
- Address: `[requestbin-url]?foo=bar bar`

The space in the string `bar bar` will not be encoded to `%20`. If you need
encoding, in Postman's Params area one can right-click on a highlighted value and
select _EncodeUriComponent_.

### Path variables

One can hard-code variables into requests in Postman, but a convenient
alternative is to use path variables.

e.g. `http://api.example.com/users/3/posts/4` can be written in Postman as
`http://api.example.com/users/:userid/posts/:postid`, and the variables will
appear in the Params section above query parameters.

Values can be added managed in the same way as query parameters are, and Postman
will submit the values in place of the variables.

This is important as it allows values to be replaced dynamically which will be
required for more advanced requests and automation.

### Headers

The Headers section will allow you to define your own headers for requests, but
also provides a list of common headers to add to requests.

### Body

Ths data sent with the request is the body. `GET` can't submit a body.

#### Form data

`form-data` and `x-www-form-urlencoded` work similarly, and simulate data sent
via forms.

Data can be entered in a similar manner as query parameters, and in RequestBin
one can see key value pairs sent through under a **Form/Post Parameters**
heading.

Raw data can also be viewed for the request.

Postman will add a `Content-type: multipart/form-data` header to requests using
`form-data`, and `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to requests
using `x-www-form-urlencoded` requests.

#### Raw data

RESTful APIs generally expect raw data, often as JSON.

After adding some JSON, select `JSON` from the dropdown next to the radios to
indicate the type of data you intend on sending in the request. Navigating to
the Headers section will show that a `Content-type: application/json` header has
been added to the request.

When updating requests, it's a good habit to evaluate how the request headers
are changing.

By clicking _Bulk Edit_ in the _Headers_ section we can toggle between raw editing
of all the current headers, or a key-value style of editing.

If you are frequently making use of custom headers, then the _Presets_ button
next to _Bulk Edit_ is useful to save and apply headers.

Viewing submitted raw data in RequestBin shows the JSON in the _Raw Body_
section of the request.

#### Binary data

Binary data is useful when sending binary data such as images etc. to a server.
Rather than copying the contents of files, Postman allows one to upload files
before making requests.

The `form-data` option for body also allows for file uploads.

### Prettifying JSON

On Mac one can use `CMD+b` to prettify data added to the _raw data_ if the
selected content type supports it.

## Importing requests from the browser

Complex requests made in the browser can be imported into Postman by doing the
following:

In Chrome:

1. In Chrome in the _Network_ tab visit the XHR filter
2. Make the request
3. Right-click on the request, and select _Copy as cURL_

In Postman

1. Click _Import_ in the top left
2. Select _Paste raw text_
3. Paste the data
4. Import

You can now view all the details pertaining to that request, and make the same
complex requests directly from Postman.

## Inspecting responses

It's important to be able to analyze requests, and Postman makes it much easier
to do so than other tools.

A response has 3 parts:

- status
- body
- headers

### Body

One can inspect a pretty formatted response body, raw, or preview for
`Content-type` responses such as HTML.

### Headers

When inspecting headers for a response, Postman allows one to get more
information for the header by hovering over the name of the header.

### Extra

If a response is a renderable asset, such as an image, Postman will render it.
To download the image, click arrow next to _Send_ and select _Send and
download_.

Postman also lets one save responses which is useful when documenting your API.
Examples are saved against specific items in a collection, and are available via
the _Examples_ link to the right of the collection item's title.

## Cookies

Cookies are technically just a header, but Postman makes dealing with them more
convenient.

**Note:** To get your local RequestBin to respond to subsequent requests, make a
request to your server directly from Postman before using your generated URL.

- Method: `GET`

In the _Headers_ section of your response, there'll be a key for `Set-Cookie`:

```
Set-Cookie â†’session=eyJyZWNlbnQiOltdfQ.XBlUxg.c76egs6AwVPUkZPKGEt1KprDRBc; HttpOnly; Path=/
```

This header instructs the browser to set a cookie. If cookies are set for a
specific domain, the browser may be required to send those cookies on subsequent
requests (e.g. using `credentials: 'include'` when making requests with
`fetch`).

When making requests, the browser sends a `Cookie` header. When getting
responses, the server will send a `Set-Cookie` header.

### Cookie manager

Postman allows one to view and manage cookies via the cookie manager which can
be opened used the _Cookies_ link on the request options bar.

Cookies are organised by domain. Clicking the name of the cookie will allow one
to edit the value of the cookie.

Postman saves cookies in the same way the browser does - Postman persists
cookies between sessions.

New cookies can be created in the Cookie manager, too. By adding:

```
MY_COOKIE=foo; path=/; domain=0.0.0.0;
```

, resending the request, and then inspecting RequestBin we can see our new
cookie was sent in our request inside the `Cookie` header. If our domain didn't
match that of our server, our cookie wouldn't have been sent through in the
request.

### Cookies tab

Because cookies have more information than other headers, Postman makes them
easier to read than other headers by adding a _Cookies_ tab in the response
section.

## Troubleshooting

- check if there is a typo in the URL
- check if the service you are calling is available
- type the domain or IP and port of your API you are calling into a browser
- ensure you're using the correct protocol
- if using self-signed certificates, configure Postman accordingly

### Configuring self-signed certificates

1. go to Preferences
2. disable _SSL certificate verification_ temporarily to see if this is indeed
   the issue. If so:
3. go to _Certficates_
4. add a certificate for the domain

The proper solution would be to create a client certificate.

### Postman console

The Postman console helps debug requests. To open it go to _View_ -> _Show
Postman console_.

Each time a request is made, responses will be logged to the console while it is
open for further inspection.
